Your task is to recreate the ZoogShip image below as accurately as possible.

![ZoogShip](zoogShip.png)

1)  Mark up the paper copy of the ZoogShip so that you know the positions (x and y values) of the different shapes.  The UFO light colors don't matter other than they should all be different.

2) Clone your project from here: [https://github.com/bradleecrockett/Zoogship](https://github.com/bradleecrockett/Zoogship)  then write the code using your marked up ZoogShip paper in class (ignore the colors for now).   
3) Watch the video: [https://youtu.be/riiJTF5-N7c](https://youtu.be/riiJTF5-N7c) or  [https://youtu.be/UFvuzapdlTY](https://youtu.be/UFvuzapdlTY) about colors in P5JS until you have enough information to properly color the ZoogShip.  
4) Submit a `.zip` folder of your completed work.
